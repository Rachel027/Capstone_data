# Import Data Manually 

**Dont need hurricane due to being already completed*

*Storm Surge Dataset* 
```{r}
stormsurge <- read_csv("globalpeaksurgedb.csv")
Encrusting_organism <- read_csv("2017-2019 Encrusting organism count and density (1).csv")
Oyster_shell <- read_csv("2017-2019 Oyster shell heights (1).csv")
```



**SKIM DATA**

```{r}
skim(Oyster_shell)
skim(Encrusting_organism)
```

```{r}
skim(stormsurge)
```
